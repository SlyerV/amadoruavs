# AmadorUAVs Software Application

## Description
This is my application for the 2025-2026 AmadorUAVs Software Division. I was able to complete Part 1 successfully and complete the dataset and YOLOv8 model for Part 2 - however, I didn't have enough time to fully train the model so I only submitted the training code which can be executed to create the run, predict, and other training directiories.

## Notes
I used a .gitignore file to ignore the source dataset folder (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KAfQYi91TXqkAYvda1gqWVxRa-ciaVZH) so you will have to input it on your own. Because I didn't fully finish Part 2, after training the model if you want to test it on data you may have to code that in yourself (sorry). Overall this was a great learning experience for me and I really hope you will accept me into the division!
