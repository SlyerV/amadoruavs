# AmadorUAVs Software Application

## Description
This is my application to the 2025-2026 AmadorUAVs Software Division. I was able to complete Part 1 successfully and complete the generator code and YOLOv8 model for Part 2 - however, I didn't have enough time to fully train the model so I only submitted the training code which can be executed to create all YOLOv8-made directiories.

## Notes
I used a .gitignore file to ignore the source dataset folder (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KAfQYi91TXqkAYvda1gqWVxRa-ciaVZH) so you will have to input it on your own (upload it to the part2 folder named as images). Because I didn't fully finish Part 2, if you want to train the model and test it on data you may have to do that yourself. All commits on September 17 (day after due date) were pushed a few hours past midnight, which I hope is okay. Overall this was a great learning experience for me and I really hope you will accept me into the division!
